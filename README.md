# Sprint Kickoff 108.3

## Automated frontend testing using Selenium and Python's `unittest` library

The `demo_functions.py` file contains 3 functions that correspond to the demo and exercise tasks from the prior Sprint Kickoff (108.2). You can leave the functions as-is or you can replace them with code you wrote last week.

The `test_demo_functions.py` file contains several test-related methods inside the `TestDemoFunctions` class. Finish writing the unit tests for `test_add_first_item_to_cart` and `test_get_fleece_jacket_price`.
